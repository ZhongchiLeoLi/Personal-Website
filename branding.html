        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
          Joya Travel & Lifestyle is a platform for both traveling enthusiasts
          looking for unique and authentic experiences and passionate locals
          willing to turn what they love into a business. People that have
          unique experiences to provide can become a provider by listing their
          different types of services such as adventure, accommodation and
          experiences onto Joya’s app platform. Travelers on the other hand, can
          book these authentic trips provided by lovely locals by using the Joya
          app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the Covid-19 pandemic has started, traveling has been extremely
          restricted and unrecommended. As a result, the team retracted and used
          this time to refine the core and structure of the product.
          Redeveloping the brand image is a huge part. A designer in this team
          is in charge of creating this brand image and building a
          representation for better brand recognition to the public. With
          feedback from the team, the Logo design, website design and the app
          design have been completed using Figma and Framer, which is all
          discussed in more detail below.
        </p>

    <div class="text">
      <h3>CONCEPT DEVELOPING</h3>
      <p>
        To start brainstorming about brand concepts, the team presented their
        old logo, websites, and filled conveyed the company’s core goals and
        messages. After understanding and getting on the same page as the rest
        of the team, it seemed that the brand theme they have created does not
        do a good job in matching with their brand identity.
      </p>
      <div class="column">
        <img src="images/tugolo.png" />
        <img src="images/tugolo-web.PNG" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Above are the brand’s old logo and their old home page header (the
        company used to be called Tugolo before the team changed it to Joya
        Travel). Together, the logo and homepage is emitting the atmosphere of a
        very rigid, organized, and strict travel company. They chose to go with
        a dark theme consisting mainly of black and white because it was clean
        looking and professional. Although that is true, it is not what one
        imagines a company like Joya Travel to look like. As a travel platform
        constructed to provide unique travel experiences unlike other big travel
        companies, these experiences are more adventure-like, more authentic,
        and target towards more adventurous and more curious people. Therefore,
        the concept of this company’s brand should be colourful, to represent
        the colourful experiences it provides and to convey the excitement of
        traveling to the viewer. The brand should also look authentic just like
        the experience providers, it should be welcoming and communicate that
        feeling closer to home. Finally, the brand should convey that
        adventurous feeling to the customers, that feeling of wanting to grab
        the backpack and head out to explore the world.
      </p>

      <h3>LOGO</h3>
      <p>
        As the icon of the company and the face that will appear everywhere
        representing the company, the logo design is crucial to setting the base
        for a brand. Tubik Studio even described the logo as the basic mark of
        brand identity, the most prominent symbol of brand image and the
        foundation of effective marketing strategy enabling its connection with
        the target audience (Tubik Studio, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
        After searching for some inspirations, the logo designs shown above were
        drafted. Starting from the top left corner, the exploration began by
        conserving the old theme of black and white and experimented with the
        initial “J”. The tail of the J drags off to becoming the tail of an
        airplane, symbolizing travel. Clean and professional as it is, the logo
        reminds me of Tik Tok and does not convey the adventurous feeling
        wanted. The experiment continued with the suitcase logo, the compass
        logo, the map pin logo and the handwritten “Joya” script, and it was not
        until the hot air balloon logo was created before the adventurous and
        authentic atmosphere started to emit. The inspirations went on and the
        Shopify Tent was created, as it is created with the Shopify colours and
        font, and made two treasure map logos, but none of them stick to me as
        much as the hot air balloon of joy. The four-colour combination, the
        backpack it is carrying, none of the others convey the same atmosphere
        as the hot air balloon. After showing the team my logos and
        communicating my insights, many rounds of voting passed and the team has
        decided to move forward with the hot air balloon.

            The design is then transferred onto Figma and continued to be
            experimented with the colours and shades as shown above. Later for
            simplicity and more iconic effect, the team decided to drop the
            letter “J” in the center and have voted the third colour
            combination. Finally, a logo that conveys the core identity of the
            company, a symbol that represents adventures and joy, the new logo
            for Joya Travel has been born.

      <h3>WEBSITE</h3>
      <div class="column">
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            After a logo is decided, the brand’s colour pallets are set. Along
            with the chosen font style, the brand theme is almost complete. The
            website is one of the most representative aspects of a brand
            identity. Especially if the product is digital, like the Joya Travel
            App, the customers will definitely check the website out before
            deciding to do business with us. The website is where the brand
            identity should come through in full force (deBara, 2017). The next
            step then is to design a website for Joya Travel that tells the
            viewers who we are and promote the app that is the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start off, a very exaggerated version of the adventurous style
            website was experimented on and the result is as shown in the right.
            This design is very lively and almost cartoonish in nature. A lot is
            happening on the page, there are lots of colours and elements of
            traveling, however it is way too complex to be a good website
            design. The main navigation of this site is guided by a stripe
            consisting of the three brand colours from the logo. As the line
            progresses down the page, the viewer is shown the content of the
            page section by section. From land to sea, displaying the joy and
            diversity of travelling. As a main principle of good website design
            in 2020, simplicity is crucial. Putting too many elements on the
            page can be very distracting to visitors from the main purpose of
            one’s website. Simplicity always works in an effective web page
            design. Clean and fresh design the website not only makes the
            website appealing but also helps the user to navigate from one page
            to another seamlessly. One should always keep the design as simple
            as possible so that the visitors can feel it easy-to-use and can
            find their ways easily (Pawar, 2018).
          </p>
        </div>
        <img src="images/joyaweb.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          With feedback from the rest of the team and more research, the final
          draft of the website design was created. With more pictures and less
          cartoon illustrations, the site is now a lot more clean and easy to
          navigate. The choice of a dark background colour is to allow the
          pictures, which are the selling-point of a travel company, to pop out
          more. If the pictures can catch a viewers’ eyes, then they are more
          likely to scroll down for more. The style of the website is also kept
          consistent from page to page. By choosing a few bold colors and
          consistently using them throughout the design, what is created is an
          immediately recognizable combination that will stay in memories of
          those who see it for a long time (Burns, 2020).

      <h3>APP</h3>
      <p>
        As the core product of Joya Travel, as the platform all of the users
        will see and use everytime they open the app, Mobile Application Design
        is of crucial importance to the company and that is why it is such a
        huge part of branding. The definition of branding has already been given
        as a set of marketing and psychological techniques and steps to promote
        a product, service, persona, etc. setting a brand. In its turn, a brand
        is an image created with a set of distinguishing features and promoting
        awareness and recognizability of the product or service on the market,
        it is what people think and know about it. Along these lines, mobile app
        marketing is the way clients will see the application collaborating with
        it: its visual picture, its correspondence, and its notoriety.
        (Yalanska, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
        The design started off to be very complicated, just like how the website
        design started off. The attempt of trying to put everything this app can
        do right in front of the users’ faces was driving the design to be way
        too cluttered. Fusing such a large number of highlights in the
        application can be one reason that clients dump the application and
        never return. This can distract users from the core idea of the app.
        Furthermore, one does not want users to focus on any ideas other than
        the core idea of the app. Choose a few primary features which are
        required to launch the app first and focus on engaging users on those
        features (Design, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the app design took a standard navigation pattern. It is
        better to use standard navigation patterns, such as the tab bar (for
        iOS) and the navigation drawer (for Android). Most of the users know
        about both navigation designs and will instinctively realize how to get
        around the application. (Babich, 2018). The features are reduced down to
        5 tabs on the app: Home, Contact, Explore, Bookmarked and Profile. Only
        the Explore tab design is completed at this moment while the rest are
        still under development. The design for the Explore tab is completed
        with very consistent and simple elements, giving the users just enough
        to show what they need to see.
      </p>
      <img src="images/phones.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        Here is the current design with colours and fonts and all those other
        design elements: they can only be effective and leave a positive
        branding effect if they are consistent. This goes for other graphics,
        navigation and the content as well. Being consistent throughout the app
        will look professional and better allow users to develop a relationship
        with the app and the brand (Paish, 2018).

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>
          The process of rebranding a brand has many crucial steps that require
          lots of researching, designing, testing and redesigning. To build a
          successful brand, one must take into consideration the viewers' and
          users’ perspective and find a way to best leave a good impression,
          convey the message, and appeal to the target audience. This process
          might be long, and the work here is still not complete, but there are
          no steps to skip. The designs will continue to shift shapes until it
          is in its best form for the audience.
